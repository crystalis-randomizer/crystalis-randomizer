Cleanups after merging v2.0.0
 - @PatchResistance in oops-all-mimics code - just patch it in TS?
 - look for asm patches to `.org $....` - see about swapping in variable reads
   or rewriting entire functions
 - split out the charge-shot-only behaviors into separate flags
 - move wraith shadows out of deterministicPreParse
 - fix swapMimicAndRecoverGraphics (deterministic.ts) to not poke the PRG directly
 - bosskill -> could consolidate some of the data table entries?

http://localhost:8081/#init=crystalis/debug&rom=orig.nes&patch=crystalis/patch&flags=@FullShuffle&seed=251f825c
 - obfuscate slots (random address, xors)
 - finish flags for flight statue skip

====

0. doesn't work in compiled mode? -> bad use of sink on getter
1. East cave mimic => shuffleMimics -> need to spread the iter
                                    -> standardmapedits 0x70 -> 0x7c
2. Randomize music broken
3. Apprentice money -> bad east cave interaction
4. Fog lamp & kirisa cave closed & desert -> didn't set 08 on effects
5. random goa entrances - missing exit/entrance pair!
    - mado 2 entrance missing one way -> bad rom patch for broken exits
6. iron wall at front of goa not staying dead -> forgot to mark
7. rage screen borked -> close caves messed it up, didn't replace it
8. shell flute not working -> entrance index matters
9. tiles below sabera elevator -> vanilla
10. fall past entrance in sabera palace -> normalized the exit
     (but it's complicated)

shuffle mado2 area

DONE:

bottom-most exit of swamp edge (re-add)
bogus stairs in windmill cave and vampire room
oasis cave near leather boots - bad dead end
east cave not shuffling
windmill guard not moved w/ random level - in general, NPCs should be on a POI
 - make it an error to _not_ move a trigger or NPC?
waterfall n -> s gets stray mountains b/c seamless pair not mirrored
