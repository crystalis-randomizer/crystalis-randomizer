Use of new expanded ROM pages
=============================

Each 8k page can fit 32 map screens.  Map planes are 64k and
fit 256 map screens.  We have started loading extra maps into
planes 4 and 5 (i.e. 40000..5ffff), which may free up some
sporadic space in plane 0, but the best bet may be stick with
keeping relocated code in the later pages (i.e. plane 7),
particularly since plane 7 already contains the relocated
segments "fe" and "ff".

Unfortunately, we don't move "fe"/"ff" until the _very_ end of
shuffling, which is problematic for using segments "1e"/"1f"
in the future.


Broken out by segment
---------------------

 * 20..27 - plane 4, currently just map screens
 * 28..2f - plane 5, currently just map screens
 * 30..37 - plane 6, unused
 * 38..3d - plane 7, new/relocated material
 * 3e, 3f - fixed pages (DO NOT USE DIRECTLY)

 3d used by stat tracker
 38 used in expandprg.s
 37 used for large fixed tables by speed.s
