Problem: Sabera 2 can delay indefinitely.

This is not present in vanilla, and seems to be caused by our fix
to prevent softlocking in reverse-goa.  In vanilla, the first instr
of the stage-0 BossPatternJump_xx for many bosses (i.e. before the
fight starts) is to load $0380,x to check if the boss is on screen,
and if so start the screen scroll/lock and (eventually) the fight
(cf. $1ec8f for Sabera 2).  This causes problems when the boss
enters the bottom of the screen, since the player is still above
the boss, and the screen locks/scrolls to the wrong map tile.
Even when this isn't an issue, it can awkwardly start the fight
while the player is on top of the boss, causing unavoidable damage.

The fix is to replace the "on screen" check with a different check,
`CheckBelowBoss`, which retains the output in the sign flag, but uses
a different criterion: whether the player is on row 9 of the same
map tile as the boss.  This works a lot better, but for some reason
Sabera 2 has a counter in $062d (i.e. $0620,x) that normally counts
any time she's visible, but now only increments on row 9, so if the
player is standing on any other row, she's not making progress.  Once
the counter hits $50, the fight starts.

Digging into the actual BossPatternJump_17 ($1ec8f), we see some setup
and a conditional break if $7d5 is zero.  $7d5 seems to track whether
the screen needs to move to keep up with the player.  It's set to zero
in KeepPlayerInCenterOfScreenIfPossible (at $7e9b3) and set to one
later in that routine (at $7ea5b) under certain conditions??

An issue is that this routine needs to keep executing, but it stops?
We could probably fix it easily by checking whether the screen is
_already locked_?

Another option is just to get rid of the delay entirely by not
doing the comparison at $1ecc0.  Those 4 bytes could just be nops.
Unfortunately, this causes surprising results if the player stabs
Mesia from behind, as is the standard practice (i.e. there's no
time to back away and you immediately get hit).  So probably best
to just check the screen lock and keep the 1-second delay.

```
