Merge stats into latest

1. Remove NMI fixup
   - OAM disable?
   - Nmt stuff?
2. Need to understand credits sequence tables (22b95..23458 or so)
   - Fix deterministic stats change to not poke directly into PRG
   - (along those lines, we'll want to fix linker to output a patch,
      will need to replace Link.orig with a slice-getter function,
      and we can just hardcode a few select bytes in the ROM snapshot)
   --> comments for The End screen explains format
       - $fx in the [0..c0) table is some other attribute

could restructure timestamp list to 4 bytes w/ id's interleaved
should consider mirroring attribute data from segment 11 to 3d?

Three main changes
0. move *.s to asm/
1. NMI changes all disable/enable NMI to soft version -> drop
   - vanilla NMI had two flags to wait for OAM -> consolidate with NMI wait
2. Move everything in NMI to extended bank
   - (adds a few cycles, but fewer than we saved elsewhere)
3. IRQ rewrite

For stattracker.s
 - put hooks at top, drawing at bottom

Needed tiles to add a few more tiles for border
 - ground image
 - bottom 4 tiles of rabbit scene -> were 4 unique grass tiles
 - double-buffers the final scene w/ text to get instant pop

Need a better PRG space debugger
