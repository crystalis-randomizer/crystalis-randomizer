;;; Add a "quest item overflow buffer", to prevent soft-locks in cases
;;; where more than either quest items are required to be held at the
;;; same time.  We repurpose eight bytes of RAM from 180..1ff
;;; ($64b8..$64bf) to store eight additional items as a FIFO queue.
;;; When the player drops an item from the quest row, we intercept the
;;; routine and instead swap it with the front of the buffer (if it
;;; exists) and replace the dropped item in the back.
