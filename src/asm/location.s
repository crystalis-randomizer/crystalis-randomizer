;;; smudge sha1 fd0dcde4f1708b30d5c3de1e463f1dde89c5cb64
;;; smudge off

;;; Patches to location change routines, including both normal exits and
;;; warps/teleports/wild warp:
;;;  1. Add a twelfth warp point
;;;  2. Set warp points on entering location, rather than by trigger
;;;     - specifically, these flags are now handled with a table
;;;  3. Optionally disable wild warp
;;;  4. Allow teleporting out of tower and boss fights (optionally)
;;;  5. Repurposes a second entry point into ReloadNpcDataForCurrentLocation
;;;     to just ReloadLocationGraphics (but not respawn everything).
;;;  6. Add an import for configuring thunder sword warp
