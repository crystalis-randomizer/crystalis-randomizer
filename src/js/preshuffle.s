;;; normal caves.  This leads to two problems: (1) when falling
;;; into a non-wide screen, the player lands _inside_ the wall;
;;; (2) the entrance and exit of Sabera's palace need to be
;;; shifted down a tile to compensate and prevent the player
;;; falling through the exit during the screen-shaking dead

;;; then the bank swap will fail.  In the case of this crash, it then reads
;;; NpcData from the wrong page, reading a 7 into the NPC type and jumping
;;; off the end of the 5-element NpcDataJump table.  The fix is to make sure
